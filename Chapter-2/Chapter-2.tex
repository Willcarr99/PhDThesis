\section{Introduction}

% I might not need an introduction section, but keep for now.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Reaction Rates} \label{sec:rates}

% Wide and narrow resonances
\subsection{Wide Resonances} \label{subsec:wide_resonances}



\subsection{Narrow Resonances} \label{subsec:narrow_resonances}

% wg = wG_aG_b/G_tot <--- Resonance strength
% G_c = 2 P_c(E_r) g_c^{2} <--- Partial width
% g_c^{2} = (hbar^{2} / 2 \mu R) * C^{2}S \phi_{R}^{2} <--- single-particle reduced width
% R = R_{0}(A_{a}^{1/3} + A_{b}^{1/3}) <--- Channel radius
% \phi_{R}^{2} --> single-particle radial wave function at R
% C^{2}S <--- Spectroscopic factor

\subsection{Gamow Window} \label{sec:Gamow}

% Include equation that estimates the resonance energies from a temperature (see Christian's book). I reference this later

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Abundance Evolution}

% Equation from Christian's book that adds the production reactions and subtracts the destruction reactions, involving the reaction rates

\section{Transfer Reactions}

% This will be the last section of this chapter
% Theory leading to C2S and proton partial-width calculations

% Random Ch 6 note when I was going to discuss transfer reactions there:
%Chapter \ref{chap:reactions} described the proton-capture reaction rate as a function of experimental quantities, such as the proton partial-width $\Gamma_{p}$ and the $\gamma$-ray partial width $\Gamma_{\gamma}$. This section will describe how the proton partial-width

\subsection{Optical Model} \label{subsec:Optical_Model}

\subsection{Distorted Wave Born Approximation} \label{subsec:DWBA}

% Theoretical model, similar to Caleb's Section in his Chapter 2

% For a surface level explanation (good for defense questions! and for intro to section), see Krane pg. 421-424.

% Include Zero-range approximation

%\subsection{Spectroscopic Factors} \label{subsec:C2S}
% Might not need this section (should be covered in both Narrow Resonance and DWBA sections)
\subsection{Proton Partial Widths} \label{subsec:PartialWidths}
% Might not need this section (should be covered in Narrow Resonance section)
