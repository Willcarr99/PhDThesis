\section{Introduction}

% I might not need an introduction section, but keep for now.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Reaction Rates} \label{sec:rates}

% Wide and narrow resonances
\subsection{Wide Resonances}



\subsection{Narrow Resonances}



\subsection{Gamow Window} \label{sec:Gamow}

% Include equation that estimates the resonance energies from a temperature (see Christian's book). I reference this later

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Abundance Evolution}

% Equation from Christian's book that adds the production reactions and subtracts the destruction reactions, involving the reaction rates

\section{Transfer Reactions}

% This will be the last section of this chapter
% Theory leading to C2S and proton partial-width calculations

% Random Ch 6 note when I was going to discuss transfer reactions there:
%Chapter \ref{chap:reactions} described the proton-capture reaction rate as a function of experimental quantities, such as the proton partial-width $\Gamma_{p}$ and the $\gamma$-ray partial width $\Gamma_{\gamma}$. This section will describe how the proton partial-width
