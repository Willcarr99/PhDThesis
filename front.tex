\begin{abstract}

The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of stellar evolution involves complex nucleosynthesis processes responsible for the production of many chemical elements observed in the universe. The signatures of active AGB nucleosynthesis have been discovered through the observation of both enhanced rubidium abundance in the atmospheres of massive O-rich AGB stars and abundance anticorrelations of light-element pairs in low-mass globular cluster stars. Massive AGB stars have even been considered a candidate nucleosynthesis host for the extreme potassium enrichment and magnesium depletion observed in the red giant stars of the globular cluster NGC 2419. Slow neutron capture during AGB thermal instabilities (the s-process) and hydrogen burning at the base of the convective hydrogen envelope (hot-bottom burning) have been shown to be sites of the nucleosynthesis for these abundance patterns. These sites are investigated in this thesis through nuclear reaction network calculations involving the reaction rates of all relevant nuclei. The discrepancy between observed and predicted rubidium abundance in massive AGB stars is investigated with a Monte Carlo reaction network. All reaction rates in the network are varied within their uncertainties to determine the rates most correlated with rubidium abundance. The discrepancy is determined to be unlikely a result of reaction rate uncertainties, but the $^{86}\mathrm{Rb}(n,\gamma)^{87}$Rb reaction rate is found to be one of the most in need of constraint. The Mg--K anticorrelation in the globular cluster NGC 2419 is investigated by constraining the key potassium-destroying reaction $^{39}\mathrm{K}(p,\gamma)^{40}\mathrm{Ca}$ using nuclear structure input from the $^{39}\mathrm{K}(^{3}\mathrm{He},d)^{40}\mathrm{Ca}$ proton-transfer reaction measurement at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory. This measurement has resolved a key $^{39}\mathrm{K}+p$ resonance, 154 keV, for the first time, among others, leading to a significant impact on the $(p,\gamma)$ reaction rate at temperatures $T \lesssim 110$ MK. Potassium production is found to decrease at these temperatures as a result, and the temperatures and densities of the hydrogen-burning candidate sites responsible for the Mg--K anticorrelation are mildly constrained.

%Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are responsible for the production of about half of all heavy elements in the universe, as well as many of the anomalous abundance patterns observed in globular clusters. These observations are signatures of complex nucleosynthesis processes, ranging from slow neutron capture due to thermal instabilities (the s-process) to high-temperature hydrogen burning (hot-bottom burning). 

%Nuclear reaction network calculations can offer insight into these processes by determining which reaction rates are important and under which stellar conditions the observations are reproduced. Laboratory nuclear reaction experiments, such as transfer reactions, can then be used to constrain the important reaction rates.

\begin{biography}
William Fox was born in Raleigh, N.C. in 1993 to his parents Daniel and Tammy Fox, who were both the inspiration for his academic pursuits. He attended Sanderson High School, where he was first exposed to physics in his senior year, unknowingly shaping his entire career. As an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, he developed a deep connection with both physics and mathematics, studying general relativity and astrophysics. He conducted research in gravitational wave theory in the midst of the first gravitational wave detection by LIGO, inspiring him to pursue graduate studies. As a graduate student at North Carolina State University, he discovered a newfound interest in experimental nuclear physics and has been drawn to its connection with astrophysics ever since.

%First, I would like thank my wonderful wife, Alex. She has been a relentless encouragement through my entire graduate studies, and I am eternally grateful for her support. Being an English Professor, she has reshaped my view of the world from a purely scientific lens to one enhanced by the art in nature. I cannot thank her enough for her countless hours listening to me incoherently ramble on about topics that I never properly introduced. Regardless, she always enthusiastically discussed them with me and helped me form coherent arguments in the end. She has been an inspiration to me through her own career, and I look forward to supporting her as she has certainly done for me.
